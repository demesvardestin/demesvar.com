                hey there, thanks for checking out my blog!
            </p>
            
            <p>
                i publish biweekly thinkpieces and chronicle my amateur
                photography prowesses, both of which sound (and are) incredible boring!
            </p>

                i'm also a self-proclaimed coconut water expert, amateur cyclist,
                and a huge fan of irreverent humor. in my spare time, i'm usually
                reading about sports, politics, tech, home renovations, philosophy,
                religion, and anything else i find interesting. i also eat an
                absurd amount of cool ranch doritos.

                i'll try to keep things up-to-date as my schedule permits.
                some of my posts will serve as an extension of my academic works,
                but for the most part, i'll probably be rambling about whatever
                piques my interest at various times.
